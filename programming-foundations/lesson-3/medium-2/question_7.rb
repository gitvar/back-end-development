# Method calls can take expressions as arguments. Suppose we define a function called rps as follows, which follows the classic rules of rock-paper-scissors game, but with a slight twist that it declares whatever hand was used in the tie as the result of that tie.

def rps(fist1, fist2)
  if fist1 == "rock"
    (fist2 == "paper") ? "paper" : "rock"
  elsif fist1 == "paper"
    (fist2 == "scissors") ? "scissors" : "paper"
  else
    (fist2 == "rock") ? "rock" : "scissors"
  end
end

# What is the result of the following call?

puts rps(rps(rps("rock", "paper"), rps("rock", "scissors")), "rock")

=> "paper"

# Launch School Answer:
# The outermost call is evaluated by determining the result of rps(rps("rock", "paper"), rps("rock", "scissors")) versus rock. In turn that means we need to evaluate the two separate results of rps("rock", "paper") and rps("rock", "scissors") and later combine them by calling rps on their individual results. Those innermost expressions will return "paper" and "rock", respectively. Calling rps on that input will return "paper". Which finally when evaluated against "rock" will return "paper".
