Take everything you've learned so far and build a mortgage calculator (or car payment calculator -- it's the same thing).

You'll need three pieces of information:

    the loan amount
    the Annual Percentage Rate (APR)
    the loan duration

From the above, you'll need to calculate the following two things:

    monthly interest rate
    loan duration in months

You can then use the formula described here: http://www.mtgprofessor.com/formulas.htm

Finally, don't forget to run your code through Rubocop.

Hints:

    Figure out what format your inputs need to be in. For example, should the interest rate be expressed as 5 or .05, if you mean 5% interest?
    If you're working with Annual Percentage Rate (APR), you'll need to convert that to a monthly interest rate.
    Be careful about the loan duration -- are you working with months or years? Choose variable names carefully to assist in remembering.
