# Write a method that takes two arguments: the first is the starting number, and the second is the ending number. Print out all numbers between the two numbers, except if a number is divisible by 3, print "Fizz", if a number is divisible by 5, print "Buzz", and finally if a number is divisible by 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz".

def fizzbuzz(num1, num2)
  (num1..num2).each do |n|
    if n % 3 == 0 && n % 5 == 0
      puts "FizzBuzz"
    elsif n % 3 == 0
      puts "Fizz"
    elsif n % 5 == 0
      puts "Buzz"
    else
      puts n
    end
  end
end

fizzbuzz(1, 30)
